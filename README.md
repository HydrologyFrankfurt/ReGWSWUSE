# ReGWSWUSE
Reprogramming project of GWSWUSE, submodel of WaterGAP. 
# Branch description
This is the first major version of the project.
This version is configurable including cell-specific output.
The aggregation of totals across all sectors works with unit harmonisation to m3/month direct in total_sectors_simulation.
In this version back-converting to m3/year or m3/month is not necessary in output_data_postprocessing.
